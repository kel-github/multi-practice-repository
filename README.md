This repository contains analysis code for preprocessing and running a DCM analysis on the data collected in the paper [Garner & Dux, 2015. Training conquers multitasking costs by dividing task representations in the frontoparietal-subcortical system. PNAS, 112(46)](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/46/14372) 


### how to use this repository:
To get a summary of the outcomes from the analyses, you can read the markdown summaries in each of these folders:
