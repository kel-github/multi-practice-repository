### Model overview
Proposing following state equation/matrix definitions:  

The A matrix assumes that all regions are endogenously coupled.  
The B matrix is an example for the modulatory influence of "multitasking". All possible 63 combinations of connections modulated by multitasking were fitted/compared.  
The C matrix is an example where driving input was assumed to occur via LIPL. Models that 
allowed driving input to LPut were also fitted/compared. 

### Q1. From which region do inputs drive the activity of the network?  
#### Figure 1: input family comparison:

#### Figure 2: Expected and exceedance probabilities for the model families w/ input to either LIPL or LPut
![Figure 2: Expected and exceedance probabilities for the model families w/ input to either LIPL or LPut](../s1_multitask_network_dcm_analysis_figs/input_family_comparison/input_FamilyExceedance.bmp)
As can be seen, the network recieves driving inputs via the putamen.

### Q2. Does multitasking modulate cortico-cortical connectivity or striatal-cortical connectivity or both?     
#### Figure 3: cortico/striatal-connectivity family comparison
![Figure 3: cortico/striatal-connectivity family comparison](../s1_multitask_network_dcm_analysis_figs/connection_family_comparison/conn_FamStruct.png)  
 Family 1 contains models where the B-parameters are only those depicted (i.e. a | b | c)
 Family 2 does not contain any models that allow cortico-cortical connectivity between LIPL and SMFC (i.e. a | b | c)
 Family 3 allows modulations to occur via cortico-cortical and striatal-cortical  
 
#### Figure 4: Expected and exceedance probabilities for the model families allowing a) only cortico-cortical modulations, b) only striatal-cortical modulations, or c) both

### Q3: Which corticocortical and striatal-cortical connections are modulated by multitasking demands?

Now that we now that multitasking modulates both cortiocortical and striatal-cortical connectivity, we perform Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to determine how confident we can be in the presence of each modulatory connection. To achieve this, we computed 95% confidence intervals for posterior distribution over each parameter (group-level estimate). Any connection that contained 0 within the 95% CIs was rejected. The remaining parameters are assumed to reflect reliable modulations of multitasking to that connection.

![Figure 5: Posterior distributions over the b parameters (modulatory connections)](../s1_multitask_network_dcm_analysis_figs/connection_family_comparison/BMA_b_params.png)

As can be seen, we reject the presence of the LIPL -> SMFC connection. All others remain - giving the final following model for the modulatory influence of multitasking...

### Control analysis: group baseline differences in the modulatory influence of multitasking?
To check that any subsequent observed differences regarding the modulatory influence of training (i.e. training vs. control group comparison from pre- to post-training) are not due to spurious baseline differences, we repeated the BMA analysis above for each group. The estimated posteriors over the b parameters are plotted by group below. As can be seen, differences can be observed between the groups on all the parameters.


#### Figure 8: Posterior distributions over the b parameters (modulatory connections, plotted by group
![Figure 8: Posterior distributions over the b parameters (modulatory connections, plotted by group)](../s1_multitask_network_dcm_analysis_figs/connection_family_comparison/control_analyses/b_params_by_sub_by_grp.png)


In order to test whether these differences were statistically larger than is expected by chance, I computed the posterior probability (pp) that the difference between groups was > 0. All pps were less than the 99% cutoff (alpha rate adjusted for multiple comparisons) (all pps < .96).

### Q4: Do individual subject parameter estimates correlate with behaviour/multitasking costs?
